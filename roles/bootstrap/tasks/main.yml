# File: roles/bootstrap/tasks/main.yml

# This role is intended to be run once after initial
# operating system installation to ensure that the system
# is ready to be controlled remotely using Ansible. That
# includes things like timezone setting and NTP time
# synchronization, installation of required packages,
# configuration of OpenSSH, initial firewall settings, 'sudo'
# access for the 'ansible' account, etc.

# This role can be applied using the generic
# 'playbooks/base_playbook.yml' file, setting the 'host'
# and 'role' variables appropriately for the target host(s).
# Be sure to use '--become' as well, as all of these tasks
# require root.
#
#  $ ansible-playbook $PBR/playbooks/bootstrap.yml \
#  > --ask-sudo-pass --ask-pass --become -e host=bootstrap
